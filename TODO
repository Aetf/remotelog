- Is reording causing failures
- same vs. different node
    * change fat_features parallelism 52->25
- timing fat_features opeartions separately
- measure CPU utilization
- try scale parallelism at 2
- queueing size at each stage
- Track how many frames goes from scale to fat_features on different machine
