- Is reording causing failures
    * increase reording buffer
- Maximum un-acked, un-failed frames -> congestion window

- [DONE] Stamp at spout ack
- [DONE] timing fat_features opeartions separately
- [DONE] split fat_features into indivitual bolts

- [DONE] measure CPU utilization
- queueing size at each stage
    * with different max pending number: 128, 64, 96
- same vs. different node
    * change fat_features parallelism 52->25
    * Track how many frames goes from scale to fat_features on different machine
- [DONE] try scale parallelism at 2

- Analysis
    * [DONE] stage sorting orders breaks when using string value for event stages
