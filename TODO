- [DONE] Is reording causing failures
    * increase reording buffer
- [DONE] Maximum un-acked, un-failed frames -> congestion window

- [DONE] Stamp at spout ack
- [DONE] timing fat_features opeartions separately
- [DONE] split fat_features into indivitual bolts

- [DONE] measure CPU utilization
- [DONE] queueing size at each stage
    * [DONE] with different max pending number: 128, 64, 96
- same vs. different node
    * change fat_features parallelism 52->25
    * Track how many frames goes from scale to fat_features on different machine
- [DONE] try scale parallelism at 2

- Analysis
    * [DONE] stage sorting orders breaks when using string value for event stages

- [DONE] Try max pending = 1 to show pure service time
    * [DONE] explain the fps graph: streamreader was paused when spout is paused
    * explain the latency graph
- Reason for periodic failures
    * spout emits many frames in one second, so these frames fail in one second later
- Effect of frameskip
    * [DONE] use frameskip on SpoutOnly
    * use frameskip on DNNTopology
