Smarter Storm Scheduler that is aware of available GPUs in the cluster, more suitable for real time video analysis kind of workloads

Modern video analysis mostly use some kind of neural network, GPU
Some latency constrains, in real-time, you can't batch everything to a large size,
GPU is probably underutilized. This opens the chance to make two GPU task running on one GPU using MPS
    - needs data support (Xiaowei) (MPS data)

G-Storm models GPU as a whole unsplittable resource,
- so each GPU task must take one GPU
- each GPU task has to be CPU/GPU switchable, otherwise, there's only one possible assignment
- pays no attention to how GPU scheduling works in OS, and simply putting two GPU tasks on a node with two GPUs can't gaurantee that each task gets one GPU
